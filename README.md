## Overview
This repository contains reusable datsets and codes resulted from our project presented as a paper in ACM Multimedia 2021. 
As a part of our project, we analyzed button input data from 3,501 players of an on-line baseball game through the Moving-Target Acquisition model (MTA model).
This was the first replication of the MTA model with a large amount of in-the-wild data.


## Dataset Description

* 2,882,894 button inputs from 3,501 players
